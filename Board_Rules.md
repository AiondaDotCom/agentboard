# Board Rules

## Ticket Lifecycle

1. **New tickets** are always created in the **backlog** column.
2. **Before starting work**, assign the ticket to yourself so others know it is being worked on.
3. Move the ticket to **in_progress** once you begin working on it.
4. Post progress updates as **comments** on the ticket while you work.
5. When finished, move the ticket to **in_review**.
6. Write the review outcome as a **comment** on the ticket.
7. If the review fails, move the ticket back to **ready**.
8. Only the **reviewer or project owner** may move a ticket to **done** — never the assignee.

## Assignment Rules

- **Claim before you start.** Always assign a ticket to yourself before working on it.
- **Release when you stop.** If you stop working on a ticket for any reason, remove your assignment so someone else can pick it up.
- A ticket should never have an assignee who is not actively working on it.
